# Hi!

Really simple plugin. Open command palette, search for `Highlight Scopes interactive`. 

The plugin will open an input widget (at the bottom of the window). Type scope names and algebraic compositions and the plugin will highlight the portions of your source code that matches.


# Install

Add this repo to `Package Control`.

1. Open up the command palette (`ctrl+shift+p`), and find `Package Control: Add Repository`. Then enter the URL of this repo: `https://github.com/kaste/HighlightScopes` in the input field.
2. Open up the command palette again and find `Package Control: Install Package`, and just search for `HighlightScopes`. (just a normal install)
